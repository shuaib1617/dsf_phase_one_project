INTRODUCTION
Welcome to the Microsoft Movie Studio Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project! In this exploration, we embark on a cinematic journey to unveil the dynamics of the film industry. As Microsoft ventures into movie production, our objective is to decipher critical insights from data analysis, offering guidance to shape the studio's strategic choices. Through this analysis, we will unearth genre preferences, financial correlations, and other essential patterns that will empower Microsoft's foray into the world of film.

PROBLEM STATEMENT

Microsoft is stepping into the movie industry, aiming to establish a successful movie studio. However, with little prior experience in filmmaking, the tech giant faces the challenge of understanding what makes a movie financially successful in today's competitive landscape. To address this, we have undertaken an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to decode the factors that drive box office success. Our mission is to provide actionable insights that will guide Microsoft's movie studio in choosing the right genres, budgets, and creative directions to produce profitable and engaging films.

OBJECTIVES

b) Budget and Profit Analysis: Analyze the relationship between production budgets and profits to understand the financial dynamics of successful films.

c) Correlation Examination: Calculate correlations between production budgets, profits, and worldwide gross to uncover patterns and dependencies.

d) Top 10 Genres: Identify the top genres by count, production budget, worldwide gross, and profit to provide actionable recommendations for Microsoft's movie studio.
